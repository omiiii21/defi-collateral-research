# Symbiotic DefaultCollateral Protocol: Mechanics & Indexing

A research and development project exploring the **Symbiotic protocol's DefaultCollateral contracts** on Ethereum.  
This repo analyzes the mechanics of **deposit/withdraw functions**, indexes deployed contract instances from the factory, and simulates collateral interactions off-chain.

## üìå Overview

This project was designed as a structured assessment to demonstrate:

1. **Theoretical Understanding**  
   - Mechanics of the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions in Symbiotic‚Äôs `DefaultCollateral` contract.  
   - Input/output token flows and key balance tracking logic.  
   - Restrictions or conditions affecting collateral withdrawals.  

2. **Indexing the Factory Contract**  
   - Fetch all deployed `DefaultCollateral` contracts from the `DefaultCollateralFactory`.  
   - Extract deposit and withdrawal tokens for each deployed contract.  
   - Handle on-chain queries using RPC (e.g., Infura).  

3. **Off-Chain Simulation**  
   - Implemented `deposit` and `withdraw` functions in Python/TypeScript (your choice).  
   - Calculate output amounts based on conversion logic.  
   - Provide a sandbox for testing collateral mechanics without deploying on-chain.
